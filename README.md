## Why This Project:
I wanted to make a simulation that shows the fundamental reality of financial decision-making: every decision, even small ones, can have substantial long-term effects on your financial future.

## Design:
Bringing my own reality into the design, I explicitly modeled the three most common financial scenarios I encounter.

1. **Steady Growth** (like a student job), represented via the **Hamster Wheel screen**.
2. **Less Informed Financial Decisions** (like "investing" in stocks I don't really know), represented as risk-based choices through the **Gambling decision screen**.
3. **Strategic Planning with Guaranteed ROIs** (like a CD at the bank), represented as the **Investment screen**.

## My Goal:
I hope users take away experiential learning through direct observation of how core financial principles of compounding, risk management, and the time-value of money play out in decision consequences.
